# Wordpress intro

This is a exercise that I had to do during my [BeCode](https://becode.org/) training. The purpose of it is to introduce Wordpress to us, but only the user side of it.  
The fictitious scenario was that a friend has a bakery and he wants a website for it. While this would have been a great project to do in Angular, React or the good old combo HTML, CSS & JS, the friend has limited funds and wants it done by yesterday😀. Therefore, Wordpress to the rescue.

## Exercise type and duration

We had 1️⃣ day to complete it (10/12/2021) and it was a solo exercise.

## How did it go?

Went well, it was the first time I used Wordpress and was suprised by how easy it was to make a small, simple website. While I appreciated the easiness of it, it was at the same time a bit frustrating when trying to modify styling, positioning and such. At least that was the feeling that I had using the user panel. I'm sure that if I would put more time into it I could lear how to use it properly.
